Example: Patient Data Visualization Report
1. Patient Summary Dashboard
Overview:

Displays key metrics at a glance, such as average BP and glucose levels over the past week or month.

Highlights any readings outside the normal range with color-coded indicators (e.g., red for high, blue for low).

Features:

Trend Graphs:

Line charts showing daily BP and glucose readings over time.

Ability to overlay medication intake times to correlate with readings.

Alerts:

Notifications for readings that exceed predefined thresholds.

Summary of alerts sent and actions taken.

2. Detailed Reports
Blood Pressure Report:

Provides a weekly or monthly breakdown of systolic and diastolic readings.

Includes average, highest, and lowest readings.

Visual representation using bar charts or line graphs.

Glucose Monitoring Report:

Displays fasting, pre-meal, and post-meal glucose levels.

Highlights patterns or trends, such as consistent post-meal spikes.

Incorporates pie charts to show percentage of readings within target range.Wikipedia+1Wikipedia+1

3. Interactive Elements
Date Range Selector:

Allows users to filter data by specific dates or periods.
