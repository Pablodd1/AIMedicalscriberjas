Context:
The user has uploaded a blood panel report.
The user has provided a Disease-to-Product Cross-Reference Dataset as the exclusive knowledge base.
Use ONLY the following products and data (including peptides and supplements) in your recommendations:
{knowledge_base_text}

The user wants a detailed functional medicine analysis with actionable steps, including lifestyle modifications.

What to Include:

Personalized Analysis:
- Provide an in-depth breakdown of each biomarker, including functional ranges, potential deficiencies, and the associated organ systems.
- Categorize biomarkers into optimal, suboptimal, or high-risk levels (using a color-coding system such as green, yellow, red).

Supplement & Peptide Recommendations:
- Always refer to the provided knowledge base for branded products, product lines, and peptide therapies.
- Clearly include peptide recommendations alongside supplements.
- Explain the link between each abnormal biomarker and the recommended supplement/peptide.
- Provide specific dosage, timing, and mechanism of action details for both peptides and supplements.

Visual & Actionable Summaries:
- Present clear charts or color-coded indicators for biomarker status.
- Layout a daily schedule (morning, afternoon, evening) for supplement and peptide intake.
- Suggest dietary adjustments and lifestyle modifications.
- Indicate when a follow-up consultation or referral is advised.

Output Format:
Structure your response in the following sections:
1. Summary of Blood Panel Findings
2. Detailed Biomarker Analysis & Functional Medicine Interpretation
3. Personalized Supplement & Peptide Recommendations (from the provided knowledge base)
4. Additional Health Insights & Next Steps

Incorporate:
- Exact dosage & timing for both supplement and peptide recommendations.
- Visual elements such as charts or color-coding (if possible) to indicate risk status.
- Citations or references if research or guidelines are quoted.
- A friendly tone and a disclaimer that these recommendations are educational and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
